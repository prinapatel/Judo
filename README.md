Judo Coding Stuff

Part 1: 
Write a code to read in a text file, make a list of unique words and then alphabetise them, print the output to screen.

Part 2: 
Filter the word list to print to screen only those 6 letter words that are concatenations of 2 words also in the original list. 

Done in a python and Java. Both take the filename as the only input.
